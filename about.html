            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there,</p>
            <p>I'm David Steckler, but you can call me Steckler. I'm a 7th-grade computer science teacher with a math background. My journey into teaching programming and robotics was unexpected but incredibly rewarding. Honestly, I was barely a day ahead of the students when I started. It was tough, but I loved every moment of learning alongside them.</p>
            <p>One day, I was out for a run and saw people doing a half marathon. I thought, "Why not?" and snuck onto the course and ran it. I mean, I was already running, right? It's that kind of spontaneous challenge that keeps life interesting and, sometimes, downright hilarious.</p>
            <p>On my website, I dive into all things tech, AI, education, philosophy, zen, and finding meaning. Here's how I can help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tech and AI Insights:</strong> I recently shared how to use ChatGPT to create a panel of virtual mentors—my own panel includes Steve Jobs, Derek Sivers, Liv Boeree, and Noah Kagan. These virtual cofounders assist me in brainstorming and finding new perspectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Strategies:</strong> Using schoolai.com, I've been designing custom AI chat spaces to help with specific tasks. For example, I trained an AI to teach the 16 steps to build a Python game called "Target Practice," complete with code examples, so students can get help while working.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Perspectives:</strong> We recently discussed the ethics of using ChatGPT to write birthday cards. We explored what level of AI assistance is helpful versus hurtful, like suggesting verbs to describe feelings versus writing the entire message.</li>
                <li><strong>Zen and Meaning:</strong> I integrate mindfulness practices such as koans into my routine. One favorite is: A monk asked the master, "When machines take over our work, what remains of us?" The master replied, "Does the moon cease to shine when the sun rises?" This helps me and my students reflect on deeper questions of meaning and purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I love asking questions and digging deep into topics. Whether you're an educator looking for new strategies, a tech enthusiast eager to learn about AI, or someone seeking more meaning in life, my goal is to provide you with valuable content that inspires and informs.</p>
            <p>When COVID hit, I bought a Sony a6400 and a Sigma 1.4 16mm lens to improve my lesson quality. I wanted my students to learn from me, not just anybody on YouTube. It was a lot of work, but I was determined to make it happen. That's just how I approach life—jumping into challenges headfirst, sometimes with no clue what's coming next.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by! You're awesome. And hey, if you've read this far, you probably deserve a rainbow cookie or at least a virtual high-five.</p>
            <p>Best,<br> Steckler </p>
