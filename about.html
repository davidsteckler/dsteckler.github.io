            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there,</p>
            <p>I'm <strong>David Steckler</strong>, but you can call me <strong>Steckler</strong>. I'm a 7th-grade computer science teacher with a math background. Teaching programming and robotics wasn't in my original plan, but it's been a <em>wild</em> and <em>rewarding</em> ride. When I started, I was literally just one day ahead of the students. It was intense, but I loved every minute of learning right alongside them.</p>
            <p>Picture this: I’m out for a casual run, see a half marathon happening, and think, <em>"Why not?"</em> So, I hop onto the course and just go for it. I mean, I was already running, so why not keep things interesting, right? That’s my approach to life—embracing <em>spontaneous challenges</em> that keep things fun and sometimes downright hilarious.</p>
            <p>On my website, I dive into the world of <em>tech, AI, education, philosophy, zen, and finding meaning</em>. Here’s the value I bring to you:</p>
            
            <h3>Tech and AI Insights:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual Mentors:</strong> I recently shared how to use ChatGPT to create a panel of virtual mentors. Imagine having <em>Steve Jobs, Derek Sivers, Liv Boeree</em>, and <em>Noah Kagan</em> on speed dial. These virtual cofounders help me brainstorm and find fresh perspectives. It's like having a dream team without the hefty payroll.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Education Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom AI Chat Spaces:</strong> Using <em>schoolai.com</em>, I’ve designed custom AI chat spaces to help with specific tasks. For example, I trained an AI to teach the 16 steps to build a Python game called "Target Practice," complete with code examples. Now, students can get help 24/7 without me needing to clone myself.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Philosophical Perspectives:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethics of AI:</strong> We recently debated the ethics of using ChatGPT to write birthday cards. When is AI assistance helpful versus harmful? Should it just suggest verbs or write the whole message? <em>Spoiler:</em> It’s a thin line between thoughtful help and becoming a Hallmark factory.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Zen and Meaning:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mindfulness Practices:</strong> I integrate mindfulness practices, like koans, into my routine. One favorite: A monk asked the master, "When machines take over our work, what remains of us?" The master replied, "Does the moon cease to shine when the sun rises?" This little gem helps me and my students ponder deeper questions about meaning and purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I thrive on asking questions and digging deep. Whether you're an educator hunting for new strategies, a tech enthusiast eager to dive into AI, or someone searching for more meaning in life, my mission is to provide you with valuable content that both inspires and informs.</p>
            
            <h3>Steckler’s Gear-Up:</h3>
            <p>When COVID hit, I bought a <strong>Sony a6400</strong> and a <strong>Sigma 1.4 16mm lens</strong> to up my lesson game. I wanted my students to learn from <em>me</em>, not just some random YouTuber. It was a ton of work, but I was determined. That’s just how I roll—diving headfirst into challenges with zero hesitation and sometimes no clue what's coming next.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by! <em>You're awesome</em>. And hey, if you’ve read this far, you definitely deserve a rainbow cookie or at least a virtual high-five.</p>
            <p>Best,<br> Steckler </p>
