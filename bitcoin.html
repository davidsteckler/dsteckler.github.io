                    <summary>What is cryptography, and what is it used for?</summary>
                    <div>
                        Cryptography is the art of creating secret codes to protect information. It ensures that only the intended people can read messages, keeping data safe in things like passwords, online chats, and banking.

                    <summary>How do secret codes (like shifting letters) help keep messages private?</summary>
                    <div>
                        Secret codes change letters or numbers in a message so it looks like gibberish. Only people who know the special rules (the key) can turn it back into the original message.

                    <summary>What is the difference between encryption and decryption?</summary>
                    <div>
                        Encryption is the process of scrambling a message to keep it secret. Decryption is turning that scrambled message back into its original form using a key.
                    </div>

                    <summary>What does a password do, and why is it an example of cryptography?</summary>
                    <div>
                        A password acts like a secret code that only you know. It verifies your identity and protects your information from others, making it a form of cryptography.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        Cryptography turns your messages into a scrambled format. Only the person you send it to, who has the key, can unscramble and read the message, keeping it safe from eavesdroppers.

                    <div>
                        Bitcoin is a type of digital money that uses secret codes to stay secure and operates without the need for banks.

                        Bitcoin was created by someone or a group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, but no one knows their true identity.

                    <div>
                        Bitcoin was created to allow people to send money directly to each other without needing banks, making transactions faster and more secure.

                    <div>
                        Decentralized means that no single person, bank, or company controls Bitcoin. Instead, it’s maintained by many computers around the world working together.

                        A blockchain is like a public ledger that records every Bitcoin transaction. It ensures transparency and security because everyone can see the transactions, but no one can change them.

                    <div>
                        Being deflationary means there’s a limited number of Bitcoin (21 million), so as more people want it, its value can increase over time.

                    <div>
                        Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist. This limit ensures that Bitcoin remains scarce.

                    <div>
                        Bitcoin is digital, has a limited supply, and isn’t controlled by any single entity, while regular cash is physical, can be printed in unlimited amounts by governments, and is centrally controlled.

                        Bitcoin is called “digital gold” because, like gold, it is scarce and valuable. However, Bitcoin is easier to transfer and use online.
