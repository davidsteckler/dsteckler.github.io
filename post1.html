        <h2>How I Built My Website (May 26th 2024)</h2>
        <p>I just built a website. And I did it with ChatGPT-4. Here's how it went down.</p>
        <p>First, ChatGPT told me I needed a web address. So, I went to <a href="https://porkbun.com" target="_blank">Porkbun.com</a>. Yes, Porkbun. If that name doesn't make you want to buy a domain, I don't know what will. I grabbed <strong>dsteckler.com</strong> for seven bucks. Seven bucks! That’s cheaper than a large coffee. It's ten bucks a year after that, but hey, I’ll deal with future-me later.</p>
        <p>Next up, ChatGPT laid out my hosting options. I picked GitHub Pages because it’s free and I like free things. Plus, I wanted a simple HTML site. Think minimalist. Think Derek Sivers. So, I made a GitHub account, then used <a href="https://trinket.io" target="_blank">Trinket.io</a> to mess with HTML code. I ran ChatGPT’s designs and tweaked them. By tweaked, I mean I changed stuff about five or six times.</p>
        <p>With my basic design ready, ChatGPT sent me back to GitHub. I made a repository, named it like ChatGPT said, and linked my domain to GitHub Pages. Boom! My site was live. Well, sort of. The HTML was there, but none of the buttons worked. Classic, right?</p>
        <p>Now, I needed those buttons to actually do something, like letting people sign up for my newsletter. This turned into a couple of hours of me talking to ChatGPT, taking screenshots, and a lot of “What now?” moments. Eventually, I found a free mailing list service and connected it to my site.</p>
        <p>And there it is—a simple, functional website. It’s not perfect, but it’s mine. And all thanks to ChatGPT-4. Also, if you're wondering, no pigs or buns were harmed in the making of this site.</p>
