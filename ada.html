  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #333; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815–1852), is remembered as the first person to recognize that a machine could go beyond pure calculation — and the first to write an algorithm meant for a computer to execute. Working in the 1840s, she imagined an age of programmable machines long before one could be built.

  <h2 style="color: #003366; margin-top: 1.8em;">What She Wrote</h2>
  <p>
    In 1843, Ada translated a paper by Italian engineer Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage’s invention — the Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer that could perform any calculation. Her translation was extraordinary not for its accuracy but for her <em>notes</em>, which were longer than the paper itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the final section, known as <strong>Note G</strong>, she outlined how the Analytical Engine could calculate a sequence called <strong>Bernoulli numbers</strong>. Her notes contained a complete step-by-step plan for how the machine would process those calculations. Today, that plan is recognized as the world’s <strong>first computer program</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #003366; margin-top: 1.8em;">Why It Was Historical</h2>
  <ul style="margin-left: 1.5em;">
    <li><strong>It was the first algorithm written for a machine.</strong> Ada designed it for a device that hadn’t even been built — pure logic expressed in a structured format.</li>
    <li><strong>She saw computers as creative tools.</strong> Lovelace predicted that machines could make art, compose music, and manipulate symbols, not just numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>She shifted attention from hardware to ideas.</strong> Babbage built the machine. Lovelace understood its potential. Her insight foreshadowed modern software engineering.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #0056b3; padding-left: 1em; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic; color: #333;">
    “The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    That single line captured her vision: machines as looms, code as threads, logic as art. More than a century before the first working computer, Ada Lovelace described what programming would one day become.
