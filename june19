        <h2>A Juneteenth to Remember: Reflections on a Spontaneous Boat Ride (June 19th, 2024)</h2>
        <p>Yesterday, I experienced a day that broke away from the routine, filled with spontaneity and joy. Having the day off for Juneteenth, my initial plan was simple: walk our dog Pixie, hit the gym at Lifetime, and enjoy a leisurely day. However, the gym was packed, every chair occupied, making the pool area an impossible retreat.</p>
        <p>Then came an unexpected twist. Leigh's gym friend, who has access to a boat rental club, invited us for a boat ride. We decided to embrace the spontaneity and met them at Stamford Harbor near PRIME. After a quick walk and feeding Pixie (wishing she could join us on the boat), we set off from Stamford to a small island off the coast of Greenwich.</p>
        <p>Being on the water felt like a return to a happy place—speeding through the waves, the wind in my face, and the endless horizon. The conversations flowed effortlessly, touching on familiar landmarks seen from a new perspective, from Tod’s Point Beach to Greenwich Avenue, and even the Delamar where my sister got married.</p>
        <p>Docking proved a challenge with no available mooring spots, leading to a humorous struggle with the anchor. Eventually, we secured a spot, and Darren tied the knot (note to self: learn more about knots). Diving into the cool, refreshing water on that hot 90-degree day was blissful, with playful remarks about the varying temperatures.</p>
        <p>Our conversations shifted to books, sharing recent favorites. I recommended Derek Rivers' "How to Live," while Darren discussed "Killing Lincoln." Karen shared "The Mountain Is You," a book she deeply connected with. Leigh, not much of a reader, listened and contributed to the lively exchange.</p>
        <p>Seeing a boat with dogs made me think of Pixie and how much fun it would be to have her on the boat, though she needs more practice in the car first. This day reinforced the value of spontaneous actions and how the water has a unique way of creating memorable experiences.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on this Juneteenth, I realize how important it is to create strong, lasting memories. Writing this down helps embed the day's events in my mind. As I type this at 10:38 PM, with my wife and dog asleep beside me, I cherish the spontaneity and joy that defined yesterday. After showering, walking, and feeding Pixie, we wrapped up the day with buffalo mac and cheese from CVS and an episode of Stranger Things, a perfect end to an unforgettable day.</p>
