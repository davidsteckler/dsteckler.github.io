        <h2>A Late Start: June 20th</h2>
        <p>Woke up late today. Why? Didn't set an alarm. Thought Leigh would wake me up. Note to self: just set the damn alarm.</p>
        <p>Rolling out of bed at 6:45, feeling frustrated. You know how I love my morning routine - coffee, quiet time, watching Pixie do her cute wake-up stretch. Today? Total rush.</p>
        <p>Pack up, take out trash, forget my wallet and AirPods. Classic me. Make it to work just in time to watch kids take the Earth Science Regents exam.</p>
        <p>Talked to this teacher who uses D&D in her lessons. Gotta ask her more about that, especially since I've been playing Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
        <p>Showed the kids that Apple developer video. Most of them weren't impressed. Mental note: need better stuff to show them. Maybe make a YouTube playlist or something.</p>
        <p>Organize Legos for robotics club, then back to exam duty. It's 92 degrees out, but the kids powered through. Snacks and water definitely helped.</p>
        <p>During downtime, read bits of "The Psychology of Money" and tried some paper trading with MSTR stock. Weird thing: I like reading this book slowly on paper, but I listen to it quickly. Go figure.</p>
        <p>After the exam: graded six classes, called parents about failing grades, printed failure sheets. More Lego organizing. Listened to Lex Fridman talking to the Perplexity AI guy. Gotta try that AI model sometime.</p>
        <p>Helped a friend move a couch. Was worried about my car at first, but felt good to help out. Bonus: saw his place for the first time. They're looking for a new spot - our apartments might work for them.</p>
        <p>Home, hang out with Pixie on the floor, then gym. Slow workout, more "Psychology of Money" listening. Had to switch from elliptical to treadmill 'cause my foot hurt. Proud moment though: ran 6 minutes at 5.4. Getting better!</p>
        <p>Back home, tried to trim Pixie's nails. She hated it, but success - smooth nails, no more scratchy paws or couch damage.</p>
        <p>Evening wind-down: Walk Pixie, dinner, wrote about that Juneteenth boat day, watched some Monk, cuddled with Pixie.</p>
        <p>Pro tip: Set your alarm. Seems small, but it sets up your whole day. Embrace the morning, you know?</p>
