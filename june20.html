        <h2>A Late Start:June 20th</h2>
        <p>I woke up today later than normal because my alarm did not go off. The reason? I didn’t set an alarm, relying on Leigh to be my wake-up call. As I write this at 11:42 PM, I’m reminded to set my alarm for tomorrow—hold on, let me do that... Perfect, they’re set.</p>
        <p>Waking up late, close to 6:45, I felt a rush of frustration. The mornings are my favorite time to enjoy the calm, drink coffee, and watch Pixie’s morning routine. She wakes up, does her puppy pose stretch, and wags her tail, excited to see Leigh and me. She pays more attention to me because she knows I’m leaving for work soon. Today, I had less time to enjoy this, motivating me to wake up earlier tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Rushed, I packed up, took out the trash, and realized I forgot my wallet and AirPods. Oops. I got to work just in time, heading straight to my classroom. I quickly got ready to proctor the Earth Science Regents exam, which was an hour and a half long, with another teacher in room 122. This teacher incorporates D&D into her lessons—students answering questions become healers, wizards, and fighters, using dice rolls to beat enemies. I need to ask her more about this; it sounds fun, especially since I started playing Baldur’s Gate 3, which is like D&D.</p>
        <p>In the morning, I posted the Apple developer con video and asked the kids to watch the first 10 minutes. Many were unimpressed, not seeing the features' usefulness. Fair enough. I need better videos—a curated playlist on YouTube or my website might help.</p>
        <p>I organized Legos for the robotics club before heading to the test room. Despite the 92-degree heat, the students did great. They had water, rice crispy treats, and Welch’s gummy snacks, which definitely helped. During proctoring, I practiced my organization skills and read bits of "The Psychology of Money." I like reading this book slowly, but I listen quickly—more to analyze and question in person with paper.</p>
        <p>I also tracked MSTR stock, thinking paper trading might give me a feel for the market. I traded at 1472 and later checked—it was down to 1440. Sad face.</p>
        <p>After proctoring, I graded six classes (four more to go), made parent phone calls about failures, and printed failure sheets. I organized more Legos and listened to an hour of Lex Fridman’s podcast with the CEO of Perplexity AI, learning about its academic research focus. I should try this model.</p>
        <p>A friend asked me to help move his couch. Initially nervous about my car, I later helped and felt proud. It was my first time seeing his apartment, 16 minutes away and 23 minutes from home. He mentioned he and his partner are looking for a new place, and she’s starting a remote speech and language practice. I suggested our apartments might be a good fit.</p>
        <p>Back home, I lay on the floor with Pixie before heading to the gym. I did my workout, texted some friends, and went slow. Listening to more "The Psychology of Money," I switched from the elliptical to the treadmill because my right foot hurt. I ran for 6 minutes at 5.4 and felt proud—it’s getting better. After the sauna and a shower, I saw some familiar faces in the locker room and again near the café—crazy!</p>
        <p>Drove home, tried Pixie’s nail tool, and she hated it. After we finished, her nails were smooth and no longer hurt me when she cutely paws at me to play, and she’s not scratching the couch now. Although at a year old, she still struggles to cuddle, Pixie’s energy makes every evening better. I’m so grateful for her. We walked, she peed but no poo. Ate dinner, lay down, wrote about my boating day on Juneteenth, watched an episode of Monk, and cuddled with Pixie. Until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Actionable Tip: Set your alarm. It’s a small act, but it sets the tone for your day. Embrace the morning, embrace the morning.</p>
