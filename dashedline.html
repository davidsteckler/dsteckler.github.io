            <h2 id="introduction-title">Introduction to Basic Drawing Commands</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Tracy's Drawing Adventure Quiz</strong>! Here, you'll learn and test your understanding of basic drawing commands used to control Tracy's movements and drawings.</p>
            <p>Master these commands to create intricate drawings and ensure your map is accurate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>penup()</strong>: Lifts Tracy's pen, allowing her to move without drawing. <em>Think "Sky writing!"</em></li>
                <li><strong>pendown()</strong>: Lowers Tracy's pen, enabling her to draw while moving. <em>Think "Ground painting!"</em></li>
                <li><strong>forward(distance)</strong>: Moves Tracy forward by the specified distance. <em>Think "Tracy's dance steps!"</em></li>
                <li><strong>backward(distance)</strong>: Moves Tracy backward by the specified distance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding how these commands interact is key to creating seamless and accurate drawings.</p>
